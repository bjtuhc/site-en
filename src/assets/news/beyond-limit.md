2018 was an extraordinary year for L4 autonomous driving technology. Despite all the difficulties and challenges, the technology managed to make its way forward. Instead of being considered as a futuristic technology, it is more of a disruptive innovation for future urban construction and human mobility. Nowadays, more and more talents with bold ideas and passion join the force to advance the technology.

Until today, WeRide’s L4 autonomous driving fleet has been operating safely and progressively for more than one year. Every day, our autonomous driving cars are running on open roads in three different cities in both the US and China. In 2018, some significant achievements have been accomplished. We made a breakthrough in the technology of crossing long-distance tunnel without GPS, which became one of our routines for road test. Besides, the retrofitted GAC GE3 was successfully operated in the stormy summer in Guangzhou, China. What’s more, WeRide, together with Baiyun Public Transportation Group, launched the very first RoboTaxi service in China three months ago, and now more routes and options are available to the public. While China Unicom’s 5G network expands its coverage all over Guangzhou International Bio Island, WeRide is well prepared for the coming of intelligent and automated connected vehicles.

At the beginning of 2019, a greater momentum was achieved. WeRide received the Series A round fundraising led by Alliance RNM as a strategic investor, followed by SenseTime Technology, ABC International, Qiming Venture Partners, He Xiaopeng, Johnson Electric, Idinvest Partners and more. WeRide becomes the first Chinese L4 autonomous driving start-up to receive investment from and form a strategic partnership with a global automotive group. WeRide has been recognized by leading enterprises in key areas including automotive OEM, AI technology, state-owned banking institution and other renowned venture capital firms from China and abroad. With the strong partnership, WeRide has taken the first-mover advantage and laying a solid foundation to head into autonomous driving era 2.0.

No matter what challenges we might face in the future, WeRide will continue driving the technology revolution, and benefit people’s everyday life with our autonomous driving solutions.

2019, WITHOUT LIMITS.
