Milken Institute, founded in 1991, is a renowned independent think tank in the U.S. Its annual Global Conference, also known as the U.S. Davos, is regarded one of the top economic events in the world. It convenes the best minds in the world to tackle the most stubborn challenges. In the past two years, a representative sample of Global Conference speakers includes: George W. Bush, Jamie Dimon, Eric Schmidt, Reese Witherspoon, Joe Biden, Paul Kagame, Jane Goodall, Masayoshi Son, Steven Mnuchin, Michael Corbat, and Tom Brady.

Before, most of the conference guests came from developed countries. Starting from 2017, more and more Chinese are onboard. This year, the spotlight casted on a group of entrepreneurs, who in the past year caught the eyes of the world as an interruptive force of technology and business model. Facing over 5000 participants during the conference, they shared their ideas on how to eliminate social and economic issues with innovation and cooperation. 

On the panel of Innovators Shaping Asia, Tony Han, Gary Liu-CEO of South China Morning Post and other innovators from Asia conducted an enlightening conversation. Tony presented the picture of Chinaâ€™s undergoing mobility revolution. Massive market is no longer the sole label of China. It now has a large community of AI talents who create the most advanced autonomous driving technology for the world. With effective business strategy and preferential government policy, China now becomes a golden area for the R&D and application of autonomous driving technology. In the age of AI, the east and the west are advancing shoulder to shoulder. This is an unprecedented scenario and China, along with Chinese enterprises are playing critical roles. Tony emphasized that in the age of AI, to eventually reach the grand vision proposed by the conference, as well as common good to the society - Driving Shared Prosperity, more communication across countries, industries and sectors should be encouraged to improve mutual understanding and experience sharing.
