### Mapping & Localization Engineer
#### You will be responsible for:
- Build state-of-the art mapping pipelines that combine data from a wide variety of sensors, as well as localization algorithms that make use of these maps in realtime.

#### Requirements:
- 3 years of professional experience (industrial experience is a plus)
- Familiar with state of the art theory for visual SLAM and place recognition
- Highly skilled in probabilistic filtering theory, computer vision and inertial pose theory
- Fluent in C++. Python skills are a plus
- Proven track record in implementing computationally expensive algorithm in commodity hardware
- Prior experience in any of pose estimation, probabilistic filtering, SLAM, nonlinear optimization
- Comfortable building in undefined and fast paced environments
- Experience in self driving technologies is a plus
